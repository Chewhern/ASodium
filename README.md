# ASodium
This is a libsodium binding that forked from Sodium.Core

Without any pre-contributors in .Net, this binding wouldn't exist.

To verify the DLL downloaded from Nuget, developer are advised to verify the DLL through the signed dll file in github.

Developers can either put the libsodium dll into their working application directory to let it work or manually adjust the environmentvariable which available on ASodium version(if it doesn't work and give dll not found exception) >=0.5.0

This is a new binding, there'll be unforeseen bugs please report to me and I'll see what I can do.
