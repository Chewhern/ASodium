# ASodium
This is a libsodium binding that forked from Sodium.Core

Without any pre-contributors in .Net, this binding wouldn't exist.

To verify the DLL downloaded from Nuget, developer are advised to verify the DLL through the signed dll file in github.

Read changelog for more details.

Wiki will be used as API documentation but it won't be as good as official libsodium's documentation, for now please **avoid using** any **functions** that has **String** or **Char** names on them in **SodiumSecureMemory**.

This is a new binding, there'll be unforeseen bugs please report to me and I'll see what I can do.
