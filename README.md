# ASodium
This is a libsodium binding that forked from Sodium.Core

Without any pre-contributors in .Net, this binding wouldn't exist.

To verify the DLL downloaded from Nuget, developer are advised to verify the DLL through the signed dll file in github.

This is a new binding, there'll be unforeseen bugs please report to me and I'll see what I can do.
